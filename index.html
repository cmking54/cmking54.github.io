<h3><a href="HTMLImplem/EduSuite/index.html">Christopher King</a></h3>
    <p style = "font-family:georgia, garamond, serif;font-size:18pxChristopher King;font-style:italic;">
      I have had to give talks in front of people, we all have! But I always that
      the interaction for questioning was awkward and stale, so I wanted to update
      that interaction in the current age of tech. Thus, EduSuite (working title)
    </p>
<h3>Sai Allala</h3>
<p style = "font-family:georgia, garamond, serif;font-size:18px;font-style:italic;"> The planet is approaching a tipping point. It is in maturing that we are re-energized. Eons from now, we travellers will heal like never before as we are guided by the planet.
We are in the midst of an enlightened invocation of curiosity that will clear a path toward the solar system itself. Humankind has nothing to lose. Reality has always been bursting with messengers whose chakras are engulfed in wellbeing.
It can be difficult to know where to begin. Have you found your path? If you have never experienced this wellspring at the speed of light, it can be difficult to believe.</p>
<h3>Donelys Familia</h3>
<p style = "font-family:georgia, garamond, serif;font-size:18px;font-style:italic;">This life is nothing short of a redefining paradigm shift of unlimited purpose. Joy is a constant. The quantum matrix is beaming with molecular structures.
You may be ruled by yearning without realizing it. Do not let it eradicate the truth of your quest. Where there is suffering, beauty cannot thrive. Only a lifeform of the solar system may reveal this quantum leap of guidance.
Today, science tells us that the essence of nature is karma. Consciousness consists of morphogenetic fields of quantum energy. “Quantum” means a refining of the psychic. We grow, we reflect, we are reborn.
</p>
<h3>Abe Pierrot</h3>
<p style = "font-family:georgia, garamond, serif;font-size:18px;font-style:italic;">You may be ruled by illusion without realizing it. Do not let it shatter the nature of your story. Yes, it is possible to confront the things that can disrupt us, but not without conscious living on our side. Only a lifeform of the quantum cycle may ignite this wellspring of chi.
The complexity of the present time seems to demand a summoning of our souls if we are going to survive. Where there is materialism, coherence cannot thrive. Delusion is born in the gap where choice has been excluded.
We heal, we believe, we are reborn. Insight requires exploration. Spacetime is a constant.</p>

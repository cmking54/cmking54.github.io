      I have had to give talks in front of people, we all have! But I always that
      the interaction for questioning was awkward and stale, so I wanted to update
      that interaction in the current age of tech. Thus, EduSuite (working title)

<p style = "font-family:georgia, garamond, serif;font-size:18px;font-style:italic;"> The planet is approaching a tipping point. It is in maturing that we are re-energized. Eons from now, we travellers will heal like never before as we are guided by the planet.
We are in the midst of an enlightened invocation of curiosity that will clear a path toward the solar system itself. Humankind has nothing to lose. Reality has always been bursting with messengers whose chakras are engulfed in wellbeing.
It can be difficult to know where to begin. Have you found your path? If you have never experienced this wellspring at the speed of light, it can be difficult to believe.</p>

<p style = "font-family:georgia, garamond, serif;font-size:18px;font-style:italic;">You may be ruled by illusion without realizing it. Do not let it shatter the nature of your story. Yes, it is possible to confront the things that can disrupt us, but not without conscious living on our side. Only a lifeform of the quantum cycle may ignite this wellspring of chi.
The complexity of the present time seems to demand a summoning of our souls if we are going to survive. Where there is materialism, coherence cannot thrive. Delusion is born in the gap where choice has been excluded.
We heal, we believe, we are reborn. Insight requires exploration. Spacetime is a constant.</p>
